<h2> Updates to the transit finder code </h2>
<p>  You can also find <a href="https://github.com/elnjensen/Tapir/commits/master">a complete update history</a> on GitHub. </p>

<ul>
<li> October 2022: Aladin finder charts now use Gaia DR3 data, and
    show Gaia variable star and eclipsing binary candidates.
</li>
<li> October 2022: You can now plan your night of observing by selecting
    the transits you plan to observe, which will hide any events that
    overlap with the selected event(s) (taking into account the
					out-of-transit baseline),
    leaving only those that don't overlap.  Use the checkboxes next to
the object name.
</li>
<li> May 2022: The NASA Exoplanet Archive target list is (finally)
    again up-to-date with the latest planets released.
</li>
<li>
March 2022: Targets for <a
href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-watch/about-exoplanet-watch/overview/"
target='_blank'>Exoplanet Watch</a> are now
    included.  
</li>
<li>
 Sep. 2021: The database of transiting planets is
    currently slightly behind the NASA list and does not include transiting
    planets added to the NASA Exoplanet Archive since April 2021.  I
    need to find time to update the code to deal with their new table
    format. I hope to do that soon. (The TOI list is up-to-date.) 
</li>
<li>
 Sep. 2020: in addition to the links to the Sky-Map
    finding charts, I have added a new interactive view for each target based on
Aladin Lite with the option to overlay <a
href="https://astro.swarthmore.edu/HiPS/TESS/">TESS images</a>; check
them out and  <a
href="mailto:ejensen1\@swarthmore.edu?Subject=Feedback on transit form"
>let me know</a> what you think.  There is also a <a
href="aladin_finder.html">standalone page</a> for these.
</li>
</ul>
